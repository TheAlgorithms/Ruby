### Bubble Sort

From [Wikipedia][bubble-wiki]: Bubble sort, sometimes referred to as sinking sort, is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list to be sorted, compares each pair of adjacent items and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until no swaps are needed, which indicates that the list is sorted.

__Properties__
* Worst case performance	O(n^2)
* Best case performance	O(n)
* Average case performance	O(n^2)

### Insertion Sort

From [Wikipedia][insertion-wiki]: Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array (or list) one item at a time. It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms such as quicksort, heapsort, or merge sort.

__Properties__
* Worst case performance	O(n^2)
* Best case performance	O(n)
* Average case performance	O(n^2)

### Selection Sort

From [Wikipedia][selection-wiki]: The algorithm divides the input list into two parts: the sublist of items already sorted, which is built up from left to right at the front (left) of the list, and the sublist of items remaining to be sorted that occupy the rest of the list. Initially, the sorted sublist is empty and the unsorted sublist is the entire input list. The algorithm proceeds by finding the smallest (or largest, depending on sorting order) element in the unsorted sublist, exchanging (swapping) it with the leftmost unsorted element (putting it in sorted order), and moving the sublist boundaries one element to the right.

__Properties__
* Worst case performance	O(n^2)
* Best case performance	O(n^2)
* Average case performance	O(n^2)

### Comb Sort

From [Wikipedia][comb-wiki]: Comb sort is a relatively simple sorting algorithm originally designed by Włodzimierz Dobosiewicz in 1980. [...] Comb sort improves on bubble sort. The basic idea is to eliminate turtles, or small values near the end of the list, since in a bubble sort these slow the sorting down tremendously. Rabbits, large values around the beginning of the list, do not pose a problem in bubble sort.

__Properties__
* Worst case performance  O(n^2)
* Best case performance O(n log)
* Average case performance  O(n^2 / 2^p) where p is the number of increments
