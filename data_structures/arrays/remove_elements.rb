# Arrays - Remove Elements
#
# Given an array nums and a value val, remove all instances of that value in-place and return the new length.
# Do not allocate extra space for another array, 
# you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.
# The order of elements can be changed. It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the new length.
#
# Example
#
# Input: nums = [3,2,2,3], val = 3
# Output: 2, nums = [2,2]
#
# Input: nums = [0,1,2,2,3,0,4,2], val = 2
# Output: 5, nums = [0,1,4,0,3]
