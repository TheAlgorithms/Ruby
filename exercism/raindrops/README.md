# Raindrops

Write a program that converts a number to a string, the contents of which depends on the number's prime factors.

- If the number contains 3 as a prime factor, output 'Pling'.
- If the number contains 5 as a prime factor, output 'Plang'.
- If the number contains 7 as a prime factor, output 'Plong'.
- If the number does not contain 3, 5, or 7 as a prime factor,
  just pass the number's digits straight through.

## Examples

- 28's prime-factorization is 2, 2, 7.
  - In raindrop-speak, this would be a simple "Plong".
- 1755 prime-factorization is 3, 3, 3, 5, 13.
  - In raindrop-speak, this would be a "PlingPlang".
- The prime factors of 34 are 2 and 17.
  - Raindrop-speak doesn't know what to make of that,
    so it just goes with the straightforward "34".

For installation and learning resources, refer to the
[exercism help page](http://exercism.io/languages/ruby).

For running the tests provided, you will need the Minitest gem. Open a
terminal window and run the following command to install minitest:

    gem install minitest

If you would like color output, you can `require 'minitest/pride'` in
the test file, or note the alternative instruction, below, for running
the test file.

In order to run the test, you can run the test file from the exercise
directory. For example, if the test suite is called
`hello_world_test.rb`, you can run the following command:

    ruby hello_world_test.rb

To include color from the command line:

    ruby -rminitest/pride hello_world_test.rb

The test files may have the execution bit set so you may also be able to
run it like this:

    ./hello_world_test.rb
